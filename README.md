## Recommended Tools
To publish a website all we need is a browser, visual studio code to write our code and make changes easily, Git Bash and Tortoise git to push/pull our code from repository and local system. I personally recommend tortise git. It made me very easy to push/pull code from repository/local system without using and commands.

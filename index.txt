I am a graduate student here  pursuing Masters in Applied Computer Science.

I have one year experience in Android and two years in Managing the complete design and launch of the company's First product www.content-kart.com.  (Links to an external site.) Handled modules in the project single handedly and made the application stable by identifying maximum issues at early stages of testing. I aspire to achieve greater heights in my future. I would like to use this knowledge to do my Masters in computer Science.

I am not completely in to development side but I know a little bit of Android and testing web applications using selenium tool. Now, I want to learn front end and other technologies too.

          Big Data,Data Visualization,Front End  Development, Android.
